Develop and create your Lambda APIs using Python, FastAPI and Serverless.

Our stack has the basic template for creating a python project using poetry(https://python-poetry.org/) and pytest(https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/). With this template you can create a basic python project to develop your projects or use this template together with our plugins to create your Lambda APIs.

With the available plugins in this stack, you will be able to develop Lambda APIs and deploy them.

The Python API Stack was developed using the best practices in software architecture:

- Test driven development.
- Clean Architecture.
- Decoupled components.
- New routes and APIs in a blink of a eye.
